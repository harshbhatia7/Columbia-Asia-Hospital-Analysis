Project Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing patient data from Columbia Asia Hospitals, a multinational healthcare provider. 
The key objectives include assessing revenue streams, optimizing staffing, and developing data-driven discount strategies to enhance financial sustainability and patient accessibility.

Data Overview
The dataset includes patient demographics, visit details, medical departments, billing information, and satisfaction scores. Key transformations applied during data cleaning include:
Handling missing values: Null values in the satisfaction score were replaced with 0.
Feature engineering: Extracted date and time separately, created a full patient name column, and converted gender abbreviations into full names.

Key Insights & Analysis
